<center><h2><font color="#000066">How to Draw the One-Body Forces</font></h2></center>

<div style="text-align: left">
<p>The idea here is to <b><font color="#660000">draw one-body
force diagrams</font> </B>with the mouse.&nbsp; A calculator is not needed
since there is no need to calculate an angle or a distance or a trig function.
Everything needed for quickly drawing real one-body force diagrams is given on the screen in one place or another.</p>

<p><b><font color="#660000">Solving any example in this series involves three 
steps.</font></B>
<br>First, you are given the object's mass times acceleration and
asked to use the mouse to draw a vector representing the resultant force on the object.
This resultant force is sometimes called &quot;the force on the object,&quot; &quot;the total 
force on the object,&quot; &quot;the net force on the object, or &quot;the sum of the forces on 
the object.&quot; They are all the same thing.</p>

<p>Second, you are given the weight of the object and asked to draw a vector representing the
non-contact force on the object, the downward force of gravity.</p>

<p>Third, you are asked to look at the physical situation and draw vectors representing the contact forces
acting on the object.  These are the forces exerted on the object by other objects through points of physical contact.
For example, a force might be exerted by a taut rope tied to the object or, if the object
is in contact with the earth, by the force with which the earth pushes back on the object to keep the object's weight from causing any further
compression or penetration of the earth by the object.</p>

<p><b><font color="#660000">The goal in each example</font></b> is to properly 
draw all of the forces acting on the object so that the sum of those forces exactly equals the resultant force 
you drew from the mass times acceleration.</p>

<p><b><font color="#660000">The reason for starting each example with an 
object's acceleration</font></B> is that in every-day life one can often note whether an object is stationary or accelerating and from that 
gauge the nature of the forces at work on the object.
Daily practice in making such observations leads to exciting and useful understandings.</p>

<table BORDER COLS=2 BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<caption><b>The working screen for each example is divided into these 4 areas:</B></CAPTION>

<tr>
<td style="width: 276px">This area contains a diagram of the physical arrangement and 
the data for the example.</td>

<td>This tiny area tells you what you must do right now: "read in area to left," "click below,"
"draw below," whatever.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="width: 276px">This area displays a list of your correctly<br>drawn vectors and their components.</td>

<td>This bigger area is where you draw vectors by holding down the left mouse button while you move the mouse.</td>
</tr>
</TABLE>
&nbsp;
<br><b><font color="#660000">The upper left area</font></B> will contain a diagram which illustrates the physical
 arrangement and environment of the example and gives its acceleration and weight.
 
<p><b><font color="#660000">The small upper right area</font></B> will tell you what to do to get started and for each step.&nbsp; 
			So when you finish a step, look up at this area to see what to do 
			next.</p>

<p><b><font color="#660000">The large lower right area</font></B>
is where you draw vectors.&nbsp; When you have drawn one correctly,
 you will be told that it is now correct and the vector will appear in component form in the area to the
 left under the heading "correctly drawn."</p>

<p><b><font color="#660000">The lower left area</font></B>
shows the components of your correctly
drawn vectors.
If components of a vector are shown in two coordinate systems, both sets of 
components will be necessary to complete the solution.</p>

<p><b><font color="#660000">How to draw a vector with the mouse:</font></B>&nbsp;
Put the mouse cursor somewhere in the lower right area and push down
on the left mouse button and hold it down. A vector will appear with its head at that
point and the coordinates of that point will be shown. Simply drag the head of the
vector to the right place and then let the mouse button up.</p>

<p><b><font color="#660000">If there is no acceleration</font></B>
(look in the upper left area) then all of the object's acceleration components are
zero so all components of the resultant force on the object are zero.&nbsp; If you are
asked to draw such a zero force vector, simply click anywhere to get a vector
and then drag the vector head to the place where both of the force components are shown as zero.</p>

<p><b><font color="#660000">When beginning an example</font></b> be sure to notice, 
in the upper left area, whether the object is said to be accelerating.<p><b><font COLOR="#660000">
You can quit an example</font></b> at any time and return to the examples menu by following your usual procedure
for going back to your browser's previous page (usually by clicking a large left-pointing arrow in your browser's
upper left corner).</p>

<p><b><font color="#660000">You can quit the entire program</font></b> at any time in the usual fashion, namely by clicking the white "X" in the red square in the extreme upper right corner of your browser 
window.</p>

of your two vectors equals your resultant force vector.&nbsp; Then <b><font COLOR="#660000">click to
